# 🃏 WarCard Duel

A simple browser-based card game inspired by the classic game "War", where a player draws against the computer to see who pulls the higher card.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Click **"New Deck"** to generate and shuffle a fresh deck of 52 cards.
- Each click on **"Draw Cards"** pulls 2 cards — one for you, one for the computer.
- The card with the higher value wins the round.
- Scores are tracked for both players.
- When no cards are left, the game displays the overall winner.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS**: For basic structure and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core game logic and DOM manipulation
- **Deck of Cards API**: Fetching a real shuffled deck and drawing cards
  - API: https://deckofcardsapi.com/

## 📚 What I Practiced

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- **DOM manipulation**
- **Event handling**
- **Working with external APIs**
- **Dynamic UI updates**
- **Conditional logic**
- **Basic game state management**
- **Separation of concerns** in JS (fetching, rendering, game logic)
